  // REVIEW: We no longer need our prototype toHtml() method. This functionality has been relocated to the view.

    // Article.loadall is a function which takes an array of records from the database as a parameter called "rows," then sorts those records by date, then uses the map function to construct a new array of new Articles which are constructed from the individual elements of the original array.
    // It is called by fetchAll on this page, which is called by the admin page and article controller.  It calls sort, map, and the Date and Article constructor.  All of these are built in, except for the last one, which is defined earlier on this page.
